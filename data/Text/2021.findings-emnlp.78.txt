Abstract

In parataxis languages like Chinese, word
meanings are constructed using speciﬁc word-
formations, which can help to disambiguate
word senses. However, such knowledge is
rarely explored in previous word sense dis-
ambiguation (WSD) methods.
In this paper,
we propose to leverage word-formation knowl-
edge to enhance Chinese WSD. We ﬁrst con-
struct a large-scale Chinese lexical sample
WSD dataset with word-formations. Then, we
propose a model FormBERT to explicitly in-
corporate word-formations into sense disam-
biguation. To further enhance generalizabil-
ity, we design a word-formation predictor mod-
ule in case word-formation annotations are
unavailable. Experimental results show that
our method brings substantial performance im-
provement over strong baselines.1
Introduction

1
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) aims to iden-
tify the sense of a polysemous word in a spe-
ciﬁc context, which beneﬁts multiple downstream
tasks (Hou et al., 2020). With copious sense-
annotated data (Raganato et al., 2017), neural WSD
methods achieve superior performance by leverag-
ing deﬁnitional and relational features in knowl-
edge bases (KB) (Luo et al., 2018a; Huang et al.,
2019; Bevilacqua and Navigli, 2020).

In parataxis languages like Chinese, word mean-
ings are highly correlated with word-formations (Li
et al., 2018), which have not been explored in WSD
thus far. Speciﬁcally, word-formations designate
how characters interact to construct meanings. As
shown in Figure 1, “征文1" with the Modiﬁer-Head
formation means solicited paper, where “征" (so-
licit) modiﬁes “文" (paper); “征文2" with the Verb-
Object formation means solicit paper, where “征"

(solicit) operates on “文" (paper). On the ﬂip side,
word-formations can be inferred from the charac-
ters (Zhu, 1982). For instance, a character combi-
nation of adjective-noun is highly probable to have
a Modiﬁer-Head formation. Thus, after correct in-
ference, word-formations can help to disambiguate
polysemous words by indicating how characters
interact in each sense.

In this paper, we propose to leverage word-
formation knowledge to enhance Chinese WSD.
We ﬁrst construct a large-scale Formation-
informed Chinese Lexical Sample WSD dataset
(FiCLS). Then, we propose a model FormBERT
to explicitly incorporate word-formations into
sense disambiguation. To enhance generalizability,
we design a word-formation predictor module to
predict word-formations for unannotated data. Ex-
perimental results show that our method brings sub-
stantial performance improvement on WSD with
a high accuracy on formation prediction, which
remains consistent in low-resource settings.

WSD methods and resources: Recent super-
vised neural WSD methods achieve superior per-
formance by leveraging lexical KB, e.g., incor-
porating deﬁnitional (Luo et al., 2018a,b; Huang
et al., 2019; Hadiwinoto et al., 2019; Blevins and
Zettlemoyer, 2020) and relational knowledge (Ku-
mar et al., 2019; Bevilacqua and Navigli, 2020).
However, these methods require copious sense-

annotated datasets (Raganato et al., 2017), which
are difﬁcult to obtain in Chinese. Thus, previous
Chinese WSD datasets (Niu et al., 2004; Jin et al.,
2007; Agirre et al., 2009; Hou et al., 2020) are
small in vocabulary size (less than 100 words ex-
cept for Agirre et al., 2009), and it is uneasy to
combine these datasets to enlarge their size, since
they differ in format, sense inventory and construc-
tion guidelines.
Word-Formation knowledge:
Instead of com-
bining roots and afﬁxes, Chinese words are con-
structed by characters using word-formations (Zhu
et al., 2019). Word-formations have shown to be
effective in multiple tasks like learning embed-
dings for parataxis languages (Park et al., 2018;
Li et al., 2018; Lin and Liu, 2019; Zheng et al.,
2021a,b). However, these works lack a clear dis-
tinction among different word-formations which
require manual annotations.

3 The FiCLS Dataset

The construction of FiCLS includes two phases:
collecting a base dataset and annotating word-
formations. Each FiCLS entry consists of (1) a
word, (2) a sense deﬁnition, (3) a word-formation,
and (4) a context sentence.

3.1 Chinese WSD Dataset
We ﬁrst construct a Chinese lexical sample WSD
base dataset. We build the sense inventory based on
the 5th edition of the Contemporary Chinese Dictio-
nary (CCD) published by the Commercial Press,2
one of the most inﬂuential Chinese dictionaries.
Compared with other widely-used Chinese lexi-
cal KBs, CCD contains deﬁnitions that are more
complete and native than HowNet sememes (Dong
and Dong, 2006) and the translated Chinese Word-
Net (Wang and Bond, 2013). CCD contains 62,241
words, of which 22.32% are polysemous. To per-
form context augmentation, we collect only polyse-

tion for a sense of “评论" with a window size of 4. The

quence in orange is the sliced new matching pattern.

mous words that are labeled with use cases (short
sequences containing the target sense), and obtain
a total of 7,064 polysemous words (20,382 senses).
Considering the distributional hypothesis (Har-
ris, 1954) that "similar distributions indiate similar
meanings", we use matching patterns to expand
the use cases into longer contexts via context aug-
mentation using the Chinese Wikipedia corpus.3
As shown in Figure 2, we slice each use case into
matching patterns of window size {3,4,5} contain-
ing the target sense. Each pattern is used to match
a longer sequence in the corpus as the new con-
text. To enhance data diversity and balance, the
new context will be sliced to produce new match-
ing patterns, which repeats for at most 30 contexts
per sense. The augmentation yields 145,964 entries
in total, where the average length and number of
contexts per sense are 53.04 and 7.16, respectively.
To ensure data quality, three mother-tongue
reviewers manually check the contexts in three
mutually-exclusive subsets of the data. Each re-
viewer is given a context and a deﬁnition to judge
whether the context matches deﬁnition as a sim-
ple binary choice question. The whole revision
takes 243 hours, where each reviewer checks about
600 entries in an hour. The ﬁnal dataset contains
121,655 entries, which is the largest Chinese lexical
sample WSD dataset so far as we know.

3.2 Word-Formation Annotations
We perform human annotation on the base dataset
to obtain word-formations. Following Liu et al.
(2018), we adopt 16 Chinese word-formations. Our
annotators are professors and postgraduates ma-

We ﬁrst propose FormBERT to incorporate
word-formations seamlessly into the BERT-based
model (Devlin et al., 2019). Speciﬁcally, given the
target word w and its word-formation annotation
m∗ for the ground-truth deﬁnition d in the context
c, we learn a formation embedding m∗ via a ma-
trix Wm for each formation type. The obtained
formation embedding m∗ is then combined with h
to produce the label probability distribution:

p(y | w, c, d, m∗) = f (h + m∗).

By incorporating the word-formations, FormBERT
is better informed of how the characters interact in
the target word to better distinguish senses. How-
ever, word-formations are expensive to acquire and
can be unavailable in other datasets. Thus, we
introduce an auxiliary formation prediction task,
motivated by the fact that word-formations can be
inferred from the characters, as stated in Section 1:

p(m | w, c) = g(w, c),
ˆm = arg max

p(m | w, c),

m

where g(·) is a MLP formation predictor. Note that
we do not utilize the BERT embeddings of the con-
text since the embeddings fuse external information
from the deﬁnition, which can be wrong in the neg-
ative triplet. The inferred formation ˆm can thus
be exploited as a supplementary formation feature.
Figure 3 gives an overview of FormBERT with FP.
During training, where the word-formations are
available, a formation prediction objective is added
for training the predictor:

Lfp = − log p(m∗ | w, c).

This objective is combined with the original sense
disambiguation loss with a weighting factor λ.
With a well-trained FP, our framework can general-
ize to data without word-formation annotations.

5 Experiments
5.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets: We split FiCLS described in Section 3
into training, validation and test sets by 8:1:1, as
shown in Table 2. Note that the validation and test
sets have the same number of positive and negative
entries, as stated in Section 4.1.
Baselines: Besides BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and
most frequent sense (MFS) as default baselines, we

jor in Chinese linguistics. Given the sense def-
inition, they annotate each sense with its word-
formation. Each entry is cross-validated by three
independent annotators and reviewed by one. With
a detailed guideline available, the inter-annotator
kappa (Fleiss and Cohen, 1973) is 92.61. Table 1
shows the top 5 word-formations in instance per-
centage. We provide the detailed annotation guide-
line and pipeline in Appendix A.

4 Methodology
4.1 Task Formulation
We formulate WSD as a sentence-level binary clas-
siﬁcation task, which has been proved to effectively
leverage deﬁnitions in BERT-based WSD meth-
ods (Huang et al., 2019). Speciﬁcally, given a tar-
get word w and its context sentence c, we construct
an instance triplet (w, c, d) using a sense deﬁni-
tion d of the target word. In this way, a positive
triplet contains the correct sense deﬁnition with
its label y∗ = 1, while a negative triplet contains
the wrong one with y∗ = 0. We ﬂatten the con-
text and deﬁnition into a character sequence with
the BERT-speciﬁc prediction token [CLS] and the
sentence boundary indicator [SEP].4 A classiﬁer
f is responsible for mapping the prediction token
representation h to the label distribution, and the
label of the triplet is predicted as:
p(y | w, c, d) = f (h),
ˆy = arg max

p(y | w, c, d).

y

Our goal is to minimize the negative log-likelihood
of the ground-truth label y∗:

Lwsd = − log p (y∗ | w, c, d) .

4We add weak supervisions in the context and the deﬁni-

tion to hint the target word following Huang et al. (2019).

implement strong baselines with features available
in FiCLS, including GLU (Hadiwinoto et al., 2019),
GlossBERT (Huang et al., 2019) and BEM (Blevins
and Zettlemoyer, 2020), and use the same settings
as our model for a fair comparison.
Experimental Conﬁgurations: We adopt BERT-
wwm-ext (Cui et al., 2020) as the base model. Our
BERT model consists of 12 layers with 768 hid-
den units. The formation predictor module is a
2-layer feedforward network with a hidden size of
768 and ReLU as the activation function. We use
AdamW with a learning rate of 4e-4 and set the
batch size to 32. We set the formation prediction
objective weight λ as 0.5 based on the validation
performance. All hyper-parameters for training
the model are tuned based on the validation perfor-
mance, as listed in Table 4. For the baselines, we
directly follow the settings in their original papers.
Speciﬁcally, 1) in BERT, we use the hidden states
of the target word for predictions; 2) GlossBERT is
formulated the same as our model; 3) GLU is based
on BERT with an additional gated linear unit for
transformation of hidden vectors; 4) BEM is based
on BERT with bi-encoders for contexts and deﬁni-
tions. Since all baselines are BERT-based, we use
the same hyper-parameter settings as our model for
a fair comparison and select the checkpoint based
on the best validation performance. Our experi-
ments are conducted on 4 RTX 2080Ti GPUs with

5.2 Evaluation Results
Table 3 shows the overall F1 results on FiCLS
across 4 main parts-of-speech (PoS). Note that we
only label PoS for the test set for a parallel compar-
ison with previous works (Blevins and Zettlemoyer,
2020), and the PoS is not included during training.
From Table 3, we have the following observa-
tions: (1) By leveraging word-formation knowl-
edge, our FormBERT achieves substantial improve-
ment by 2.84 F1 points more than GlossBERT,
which validates that word-formations can effec-
tively enhance Chinese WSD. (2) Although Form-
BERT w/ FP has no ground-truth word-formation
annotations, it achieves comparable results with
FormBERT, which conﬁrms the generalizability
of our method. We speculate that the slight
advantage over FormBERT can be owing to (i)
the signiﬁcantly-high 93.29 accuracy of word-
formation predictions, and (ii) the implicitly reg-
ularized context embeddings from the formation
prediction objective. (3) Concerning the perfor-
mance on different PoS, most models perform the
worst on adverbs. This can be explained by the high
granularity of adverbs in the CCD sense inventory,
e.g., the adverb “一头" consists of 8 senses, 6 of
which denote the similar meaning of “directly".

5.3 Analysis
Generalizability of FP: To test the generalizabil-
ity of FP, we evaluate it on an additional set of 500
senses of polysemous words that are unavailable
during training. Results show that FP achieves a

921high accuracy of 92.80, which validates that FP can
be highly generalizable to other datasets. Note that
we do not apply our method on previous datasets
since they differ in sense inventory and construc-
tion guidelines, as stated in Section 2.
FormBERT in low-resource settings: To better
understand the overall results, we divide the test set
into four subsets: (1) entries with the most frequent
deﬁnition (MFD) of the target word, (2) entries
with the less frequent deﬁnitions (LFD) than MFD,
(3) zero-shot entries of unseen deﬁnitions during
training, and (4) few-shot entries of deﬁnitions ap-
pearing less than ﬁve times during training. We
compare FormBERT with and without FP against
GlossBERT and BEM, as shown in Table 5. Re-
sults indicate that, by leveraging word-formations,
both FormBERT with and without FP introduce
consistent improvement over the baselines, which
validates that our method is effective and robust
even in low-resource settings.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose to enhance Chinese WSD
with word-formation knowledge. We ﬁrst construct
a large-scale formation-informed dataset. Then,
we propose FormBERT to incorporate the word-
formations into BERT and design a formation pre-
dictor to ease the reliance on annotated data. Exper-
imental results validate the effectiveness of lever-
aging word-formations for Chinese WSD.
