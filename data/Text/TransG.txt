Abstract

Recently, knowledge graph embedding,
which projects symbolic entities and re-
lations into continuous vector space, has
become a new, hot topic in artiﬁcial in-
telligence. This paper proposes a novel
generative model (TransG) to address
the issue of multiple relation semantics
that a relation may have multiple mean-
ings revealed by the entity pairs associ-
ated with the corresponding triples. The
new model can discover latent seman-
tics for a relation and leverage a mix-
ture of relation-speciﬁc component vec-
tors to embed a fact triple. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst gen-
erative model for knowledge graph em-
bedding, and at the ﬁrst time, the issue
of multiple relation semantics is formally
discussed. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed model achieves substan-
tial improvements against the state-of-the-
art baselines. All of the related poster,
slides, datasets and codes have been pub-
lished in http://www.ibookman.

Introduction

1
Abstract or real-world knowledge is always a ma-
jor topic in Artiﬁcial Intelligence. Knowledge
bases such as Wordnet (Miller, 1995) and Free-
base (Bollacker et al., 2008) have been shown very
useful to AI tasks including question answering,
knowledge inference, and so on. However, tra-
ditional knowledge bases are symbolic and logic,
thus numerical machine learning methods can-
not be leveraged to support the computation over
the knowledge bases. To this end, knowledge
graph embedding has been proposed to project en-

tities and relations into continuous vector spaces.
Among various embedding models, there is a line
of translation-based models such as TransE (Bor-
des et al., 2013), TransH (Wang et al., 2014),
TransR (Lin et al., 2015b), and other related mod-
els (He et al., 2015) (Lin et al., 2015a).

Figure 1: Visualization of TransE embedding vec-
tors with PCA dimension reduction. Four relations
(a ∼ d) are chosen from Freebase and Wordnet.
A dot denotes a triple and its position is decided
by the difference vector between tail and head en-
tity (t − h). Since TransE adopts the principle of
t − h ≈ r, there is supposed to be only one cluster
whose centre is the relation vector r. However, re-
sults show that there exist multiple clusters, which
justiﬁes our multiple relation semantics assump-
tion.

A fact of knowledge base can usually be rep-
resented by a triple (h, r, t) where h, r, t indicate
a head entity, a relation, and a tail entity, respec-

Figure 2: Visualization of multiple relation semantics. The data are selected from Wordnet. The dots
are correct triples that belong to HasPart relation, while the circles are incorrect ones. The point coor-
dinate is the difference vector between tail and head entity, which should be near to the centre. (a) The
correct triples are hard to be distinguished from the incorrect ones. (b) By applying multiple semantic
components, our proposed model could discriminate the correct triples from the wrong ones.

tively. All translation-based models almost follow
the same principle hr + r ≈ tr where hr, r, tr in-
dicate the embedding vectors of triple (h, r, t),
with the head and tail entity vector projected with
respect to the relation space.

In spite of the success of these models, none
of the previous models has formally discussed
the issue of multiple relation semantics that a
relation may have multiple meanings revealed by
the entity pairs associated with the corresponding
triples. As can be seen from Fig. 1, visualization
results on embedding vectors obtained from
TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) show that,
there
are different clusters for a speciﬁc relation,
and different clusters indicate different
latent
semantics. For example, the relation HasPart has
at least two latent semantics: composition-related
as (Table, HasPart, Leg) and location-related
as (Atlantics, HasPart, NewYorkBay). As one
more example,
in Freebase, (Jon Snow, birth
place, Winter Fall) and (George R. R. Martin,
birth place, U.S.) are mapped to schema /ﬁc-
tional universe/ﬁctional character/place of birth
and /people/person/place of birth respectively,
indicating that birth place has different meanings.
This phenomenon is quite common in knowledge
bases for two reasons: artiﬁcial simpliﬁcation and
nature of knowledge. On one hand, knowledge
base curators could not involve too many similar
relations, so abstracting multiple similar relations
into one speciﬁc relation is a common trick. On
the other hand, both language and knowledge
representations often involve ambiguous infor-
mation. The ambiguity of knowledge means a

semantic mixture. For example, when we mention
“Expert”, we may refer to scientist, businessman
or writer, so the concept “Expert” may be ambigu-
ous in a speciﬁc situation, or generally a semantic
mixture of these cases.
However, since previous translation-based mod-
els adopt hr + r ≈ tr, they assign only one trans-
lation vector for one relation, and these models are
not able to deal with the issue of multiple relation
semantics. To illustrate more clearly, as showed
in Fig.2, there is only one unique representation
for relation HasPart in traditional models, thus
the models made more errors when embedding the
triples of the relation.
Instead, in our proposed
model, we leverage a Bayesian non-parametric in-
ﬁnite mixture model to handle multiple relation se-
mantics by generating multiple translation compo-
nents for a relation. Thus, different semantics are
characterized by different components in our em-
bedding model. For example, we can distinguish
the two clusters HasPart.1 or HasPart.2, where
the relation semantics are automatically clustered
to represent the meaning of associated entity pairs.
To summarize, our contributions are as follows:
• We propose a new issue in knowledge graph
embedding, multiple relation semantics that
a relation in knowledge graph may have dif-
ferent meanings revealed by the associated
entity pairs, which has never been studied
previously.

• To address the above issue, we propose a
novel Bayesian non-parametric inﬁnite mix-
ture embedding model, TransG. The model

can automatically discover semantic clusters
of a relation, and leverage a mixture of multi-
ple relation components for translating an en-
tity pair. Moreover, we present new insights
from the generative perspective.

• Extensive experiments show that our pro-
improve-

posed model obtains substantial
ments against the state-of-the-art baselines.

2 Related Work

Prior studies are classiﬁed into two branches:
translation-based embedding methods and the oth-
ers.

2.1 Translation-Based Embedding Methods
Existing translation-based embedding methods
share the same translation principle h + r ≈ t and
the score function is designed as:

fr(h, t) = ||hr + r − tr||2

2

r hwr, tr = t − w(cid:62)

where hr, tr are entity embedding vectors pro-
jected in the relation-speciﬁc space. TransE (Bor-
des et al., 2013), lays the entities in the original en-
tity space: hr = h, tr = t. TransH (Wang et al.,
2014), projects entities into a hyperplane for ad-
dressing the issue of complex relation embedding:
hr = h − w(cid:62)
r twr. To address
the same issue, TransR (Lin et al., 2015b), trans-
forms the entity embeddings by the same relation-
speciﬁc matrix: hr = Mrh, tr = Mrt. TransR
also proposes an ad-hoc clustering-based method,
CTransR, where the entity pairs for a relation are
clustered into different groups, and the pairs in
the same group share the same relation vector. In
comparison, our model is more elegant to address
such an issue theoretically, and does not require a
pre-process of clustering. Furthermore, our model
has much better performance than CTransR, as
we expect. TransM (Fan et al., 2014) lever-
ages the structure of the knowledge graph via pre-
calculating the distinct weight for each training
triple to enhance embedding. KG2E (He et al.,
2015) is a probabilistic embedding method for
modeling the uncertainty in knowledge graph.

2.2 Pioneering Embedding Methods
There list the pioneering embedding approaches:
Structured Embedding (SE). The SE model
(Bordes et al., 2011) transforms the entity space
with the head-speciﬁc and tail-speciﬁc matrices.

The score function is deﬁned as fr(h, t) =
||Mh,rh − Mt,rt||. According to (Socher et
al., 2013),
this model cannot capture the re-
lationship between entities. Semantic Match-
ing Energy (SME). The SME model (Bordes
et al., 2012) (Bordes et al., 2014) can han-
dle the correlations between entities and rela-
tions by matrix product and Hadamard prod-
uct.
In some recent work (Bordes et al., 2014),
the score function is re-deﬁned with 3-way ten-
sors instead of matrices. Single Layer Model
(SLM). SLM applies neural network to knowl-
edge graph embedding. The score function is de-
ﬁned as fr(h, t) = u(cid:62)
r g(Mr,1h + Mr,2t) where
Mr,1, Mr,2 are relation-speciﬁc weight matrices.
Collobert had applied a similar method into the
language model, (Collobert and Weston, 2008).
Latent Factor Model (LFM). The LFM (Jenat-
ton et al., 2012), (Sutskever et al., 2009) attempts
to capture the second-order correlations between
entities by a quadratic form. The score func-
tion is as fr(h, t) = h(cid:62)Wrt. Neural Ten-
sor Network (NTN). The NTN model (Socher et
al., 2013) deﬁnes a very expressive score func-
tion to combine the SLM and LFM: fr(h, t) =
u(cid:62)
r g(h(cid:62)W··rt + Mr,1h + Mr,2t + br), where
ur is a relation-speciﬁc linear layer, g(·) is the
tanh function, W ∈ Rd×d×k is a 3-way tensor.
Unstructured Model (UM). The UM (Bordes et
al., 2012) may be a simpliﬁed version of TransE
without considering any relation-related informa-
tion. The score function is directly deﬁned as
fr(h, t) = ||h − t||2
2. RESCAL. This is a col-
lective matrix factorization model which is also
a common method in knowledge base embedding
(Nickel et al., 2011), (Nickel et al., 2012).

Semantically Smooth Embedding (SSE).
(Guo et al., 2015) aims at further discovering the
geometric structure of the embedding space to
make it semantically smooth. (Wang et al., 2014)
focuses on bridging the gap between knowledge
and texts, with a joint loss function for knowledge
graph and text corpus. (Wang et al., 2015) incor-
porates the rules that are related with relation types
such as 1-N and N-1. PTransE. (Lin et al., 2015a)
is a path-based embedding model, simultaneously
considering the information and conﬁdence level
of the path in knowledge graph.

3 Methods
3.1 TransG: A Generative Model for

Embedding

As just mentioned, only one single translation vec-
tor for a relation may be insufﬁcient to model mul-
tiple relation semantics.
In this paper, we pro-
pose to use Bayesian non-parametric inﬁnite mix-
ture embedding model (Grifﬁths and Ghahramani,
2011). The generative process of the model is as
follows:
1. For an entity e ∈ E:

(a) Draw each entity embedding mean vec-
tor from a standard normal distribution
as a prior: ue (cid:118) N (0, 1).

2. For a triple (h, r, t) ∈ ∆:

(a) Draw a semantic component from Chi-
nese Restaurant Process for this relation:
πr,m ∼ CRP (β).

(b) Draw a head entity embedding vec-
tor from a normal distribution: h (cid:118)
N (uh, σ2

hE).

(c) Draw a tail entity embedding vec-
tor from a normal distribution: t (cid:118)
N (ut, σ2
(d) Draw a relation embedding vector for
this semantics: ur,m = t − h (cid:118)
N (ut − uh, (σ2

t E).

t )E).

h + σ2

where uh and ut indicate the mean embedding
vector for head and tail respectively, σh and σt
indicate the variance of corresponding entity dis-
tribution respectively, and ur,m is the m-th com-
ponent translation vector of relation r. Chinese
Restaurant Process (CRP) is a Dirichlet Process
and it can automatically detect semantic compo-
nents. In this setting, we obtain the score function
as below:

P{(h, r, t)} ∝ Mr(cid:88)
Mr(cid:88)

m=1

=

πr,mP(ur,m|h, t)

− ||uh+ur,m−ut||2

2

σ2
h

+σ2
t

πr,me

(1)

m=1

where πr,m is the mixing factor, indicating the
weight of i-th component and Mr is the number
of semantic components for the relation r, which
is learned from the data automatically by the CRP.

Inspired by Fig.1, TransG leverages a mixture
of relation component vectors for a speciﬁc re-
lation. Each component represents a speciﬁc la-
tent meaning. By this way, TransG could distin-
guish multiple relation semantics. Notably, the
CRP could generate multiple semantic compo-
nents when it is necessary and the relation seman-
tic component number Mr is learned adaptively
from the data.

3.2 Explanation from the Geometry

Perspective

Similar to previous studies, TransG has geometric
explanations. In the previous methods, when the
relation r of triple (h, r, t) is given, the geometric
representations are ﬁxed, as h + r ≈ t. However,
TransG generalizes this geometric principle to:
− ||uh+ur,m−ut||2

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

2

m∗

(h,r,t) = arg max
m=1...Mr

πr,me

σ2
h

+σ2
t

h + ur,m∗

(h,r,t)

≈ t

(2)

where m∗
(h,r,t) is the index of primary compo-
nent. Though all the components contribute to the
model, the primary one contributes the most due
to the exponential effect (exp(·)). When a triple
(h, r, t) is given, TransG works out the index of
primary component then translates the head entity
to the tail one with the primary translation vector.
For most triples, there should be only one com-
ponent that have signiﬁcant non-zero value as

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

− ||uh+ur,m−ut||2

2

σ2
h

+σ2
t

πr,me

and the others would

be small enough, due to the exponential decay.
This property reduces the noise from the other
semantic components to better characterize mul-
tiple relation semantics. In detail, (t − h) is al-
most around only one translation vector ur,m∗
in TransG. Under the condition m (cid:54)= m∗

(h,r,t),
is very large so that the expo-
nential function value is very small. This is why
the primary component could represent the corre-
sponding semantics.

(cid:16)||uh+ur,m−ut||2

σ2
h+σ2
t

(cid:17)

(h,r,t)

2

To summarize, previous studies make transla-
tion identically for all the triples of the same re-
lation, but TransG automatically selects the best
translation vector according to the speciﬁc seman-
tics of a triple. Therefore, TransG could focus on
the speciﬁc semantic embedding to avoid much
noise from the other unrelated semantic compo-
nents and result in promising improvements than

existing methods. Note that, all the components in
TransG have their own contributions, but the pri-
mary one makes the most.

3.3 Training Algorithm
The maximum data likelihood principle is applied
for training. As to the non-parametric part, πr,m
is generated from the CRP with Gibbs Sampling,
similar to (He et al., 2015) and (Grifﬁths and
Ghahramani, 2011). A new component is sampled
for a triple (h,r,t) with the below probability:

P(mr,new) =

− ||h−t||2

σ2
t +2
h

βe
− ||h−t||2
t +2 + P{(h, r, t)}

βe

(3)

where P{(h, r, t)} is the current posterior prob-
ability. As to other parts, in order to better distin-
guish the true triples from the false ones, we max-
imize the ratio of likelihood of the true triples to
that of the false ones. Notably, the embedding vec-
tors are initialized by (Glorot and Bengio, 2010).
Putting all the other constraints together, the ﬁnal
objective function is obtained, as follows:

ln

 Mr(cid:88)

(h,r,t)∈∆

where ∆ is the set of golden triples and ∆(cid:48) is the
set of false triples. C controls the scaling degree.
E is the set of entities and R is the set of relations.
Noted that the mixing factors π and the variances
σ are also learned jointly in the optimization.

SGD is applied to solve this optimization prob-
lem. In addition, we apply a trick to control the

parameter updating process during training. For
those very impossible triples, the update process is
skipped. Hence, we introduce a similar condition
as TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) adopts: the train-
ing algorithm will update the embedding vectors
only if the below condition is satisﬁed:

P{(h, r, t)}
P{(h(cid:48), r(cid:48), t(cid:48))} =

(cid:80)Mr
(cid:80)Mr(cid:48)

(5)

where (h, r, t) ∈ ∆ and (h(cid:48), r(cid:48), t(cid:48)) ∈ ∆(cid:48). γ con-
trols the updating condition.

As to the efﬁciency, in theory, the time com-
plexity of TransG is bounded by a small constant
M compared to TransE, that is O(TransG) =
O(M × O(TransE)) where M is the number of
semantic components in the model. Note that
TransE is the fastest method among translation-
based methods. The experiment of Link Predic-
tion shows that TransG and TransE would con-
verge at around 500 epochs, meaning there is also
no signiﬁcant difference in convergence speed. In
experiment, TransG takes 4.8s for one iteration on
FB15K while TransR costs 136.8s and PTransE
costs 1200.0s on the same computer for the same
dataset.

4 Experiments

Our experiments are conducted on four public
benchmark datasets that are the subsets of Word-
net and Freebase, respectively. The statistics of
these datasets are listed in Tab.1. Experiments
are conducted on two tasks : Link Prediction and
Triple Classiﬁcation. To further demonstrate how
the proposed model approaches multiple relation
semantics, we present semantic component analy-
sis at the end of this section.

4.1 Link Prediction
Link prediction concerns knowledge graph com-
pletion: when given an entity and a relation, the
embedding models predict the other missing en-
tity. More speciﬁcally, in this task, we predict t
given (h, r,∗), or predict h given (∗, r, t). The
WN18 and FB15K are two benchmark datasets for
this task. Note that many AI tasks could be en-
hanced by Link Prediction such as relation extrac-
tion (Hoffmann et al., 2011).

Evaluation Protocol. We adopt the same proto-
col used in previous studies. For each testing triple
(h, r, t), we corrupt it by replacing the tail t (or the
head h) with every entity e in the knowledge graph
and calculate a probabilistic score of this corrupted
triple (h, r, e) (or (e, r, t)) with the score function
fr(h, e). After ranking these scores in descend-
ing order, we obtain the rank of the original triple.
There are two metrics for evaluation: the averaged
rank (Mean Rank) and the proportion of testing
triple whose rank is not larger than 10 (HITS@10).
This is called “Raw” setting. When we ﬁlter out
the corrupted triples that exist in the training, val-
idation, or test datasets, this is the“Filter” setting.
If a corrupted triple exists in the knowledge graph,
ranking it ahead the original triple is also accept-
able. To eliminate this case, the “Filter” setting
is preferred. In both settings, a lower Mean Rank
and a higher HITS@10 mean better performance.
Implementation. As the datasets are the same,
we directly report the experimental results of sev-
eral baselines from the literature, as in (Bordes
et al., 2013), (Wang et al., 2014) and (Lin et al.,
2015b). We have attempted several settings on
the validation dataset to get the best conﬁguration.
For example, we have tried the dimensions of 100,
200, 300, 400. Under the “bern.” sampling strat-
egy, the optimal conﬁgurations are: learning rate
α = 0.001, the embedding dimension k = 100,
γ = 2.5, β = 0.05 on WN18; α = 0.0015,
k = 400, γ = 3.0, β = 0.1 on FB15K. Note
that all the symbols are introduced in “Methods”.
We train the model until it converges in previous
version (about 10,000 rounds), but we provide the
results of 2,000 rounds for comparison in current
version.

Results.

Evaluation results on WN18 and
FB15K are reported in Tab.2 and Tab.3. We ob-

serve that:

1. TransG outperforms all the baselines obvi-
ously. Compared to TransR, TransG makes
improvements by 2.9% on WN18 and 26.0%
on FB15K, and the averaged semantic com-
ponent number on WN18 is 5.67 and that on
FB15K is 8.77. This result demonstrates cap-
turing multiple relation semantics would ben-
eﬁt embedding.

2. The model has a bad Mean Rank score on
the WN18 and FB15K dataset. Further anal-
ysis shows that there are 24 testing triples
(0.5% of the testing set) whose ranks are
more than 30,000, and these few cases would
lead to about 150 mean rank loss. Among
these triples, there are 23 triples whose tail
or head entities have never been co-occurring
with the corresponding relations in the train-
ing set.
In one word, there is no sufﬁcient
training data for those relations and entities.

3. Compared to CTransR, TransG solves the
multiple relation semantics problem much
better for two reasons. Firstly, CTransR clus-
ters the entity pairs for a speciﬁc relation and
then performs embedding for each cluster,
but TransG deals with embedding and multi-
ple relation semantics simultaneously, where
the two processes can be enhanced by each
other. Secondly, CTransR models a triple by
only one cluster, but TransG applies a mix-
ture to reﬁne the embedding.

Our model is almost insensitive to the dimen-
sion if that is sufﬁcient.
For the dimensions
of 100, 200, 300, 400, the HITS@10 of TransG
on FB15 are 81.8%, 84.0%, 85.8%, 88.2%, while
those of TransE are 47.1%, 48.5%, 51.3%, 49.2%.

on WN11, and “bern” sampling, α = 0.002,
k = 400, γ = 3.0, β = 0.1 on FB13.

Results. Accuracies are reported in Tab.5 and

Fig.4. The following are our observations:

1. TransG outperforms all the baselines remark-
ably. Compared to TransR, TransG improves
by 1.7% on WN11 and 5.8% on FB13, and
the averaged semantic component number on
WN11 is 2.63 and that on FB13 is 4.53. This
result shows the beneﬁt of capturing multiple
relation semantics for a relation.

2. The relations, such as “Synset Domain” and
“Type Of”, which hold more semantic com-
ponents, are improved much more. In com-
parison, the relation “Similar” holds only one
semantic component and is almost not pro-
moted. This further demonstrates that cap-
turing multiple relation semantics can beneﬁt
embedding.

4.3 Semantic Component Analysis
In this subsection, we analyse the number of se-
mantic components for different relations and list
the component number on the dataset WN18 and
FB13 in Fig.3.

Results. As Fig. 3 and Tab. 4 show, we have the

following observations:

1. Multiple semantic components are indeed
necessary for most relations. Except for re-
lations such as “Also See”, “Synset Usage”
and “Gender”, all other relations have more
than one semantic component.

2. Different components

4.2 Triple Classiﬁcation
In order to testify the discriminative capability be-
tween true and false facts, triple classiﬁcation is
conducted. This is a classical task in knowledge
base embedding, which aims at predicting whether
a given triple (h, r, t) is correct or not. WN11
and FB13 are the benchmark datasets for this task.
Note that evaluation of classiﬁcation needs nega-
tive samples, and the datasets have already pro-
vided negative triples.

Evaluation Protocol. The decision process is
very simple as follows:
for a triple (h, r, t), if
fr(h, t) is below a threshold σr, then positive; oth-
erwise negative. The thresholds {σr} are deter-
mined on the validation dataset.

ferent embedding methods.

Implementation. As all methods use the same
datasets, we directly re-use the results of different
methods from the literature. We have attempted
several settings on the validation dataset to ﬁnd
the best conﬁguration. The optimal conﬁgurations
of TransG are as follows: “bern” sampling, learn-
ing rate α = 0.001, k = 50, γ = 6.0, β = 0.1

3. WN11 and WN18 are different subsets of
Wordnet. As we know, the semantic compo-
nent number is decided on the triples in the
dataset. Therefore, It’s reasonable that sim-
ilar relations, such as “Synset Domain” and
“Synset Usage” may hold different semantic
numbers for WN11 and WN18.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a generative Bayesian
non-parametric inﬁnite mixture embedding model,
TransG, to address a new issue, multiple relation
semantics, which can be commonly seen in knowl-
edge graph. TransG can discover the latent se-
mantics of a relation automatically and leverage
a mixture of relation components for embedding.
Extensive experiments show our method achieves
substantial improvements against the state-of-the-
art baselines.

6 Code Tricks

1. The class “TransG” is the experimental
version, rather than “TransG Hierarchical”.
Note that, for numerical stabilization, we ﬁx
the variance σ as a constant.

2. When generating the new cluster, we assign
the CRP factor as the mixture factor, which
is required by CRP theoretically. But as to
the center of new cluster, we assign a random
vector rather than t − h. Because in big data
scenario, theoretical center is far away from
the ground-truth.

3. Regarding the learning methodology of pa-
rameter π and σ, we applied the stochastic
gradient ascent (SGD) for efﬁciency, rather
than likelihood counting, which is naturally
suitable for CRP but inefﬁcient. We suggest
the reader to implement both for experiments.

4. Due to the slow convergence rate, in previ-
ous version, we train the model until conver-
gence, almost around 10,000 epos. But in
current version, we conduct the same rounds
with other baselines 2,000 rounds).
