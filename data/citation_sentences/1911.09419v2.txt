Li et al. (2016) embed entities and categories jointly into a semantic space and designs models for the concept categorization and dataless hierarchical classiﬁcation tasks.
Zhang et al. (2018) use clustering algorithms to model the hierarchical relation structures.
Xie, Liu, and Sun (2016) proposed TKRL, which embeds the type information into knowledge graph embeddings.
As pointed out by Toutanova and Chen (2015) and Dettmers et al. (2018), WN18 and FB15k suffer from the test set leakage problem.
Evaluation Protocol Following Bordes et al. (2013), for each triple (h, r, t) in the test dataset, we replace either the head entity h or the tail entity t with each candidate entity to create a set of candidate triples.
It is worth noting that we use the “Filtered” setting as in Bordes et al. (2013), which does not take any existing valid triples into accounts at ranking.
Results of TransE and RotatE are taken from Nguyen et al. (2018) and Sun et al.
Other results are taken from Dettmers et al. (2018).
