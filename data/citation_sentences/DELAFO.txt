There are popular techniques, including autoregressive moving average (ARMA) [3], autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) [4], and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) [5].
Duy and co-workers combine deep neural networks and Gaussian mixture models for extracting brain tissues from high-resolution magnetic resonance images [7].
DELAFO: An Eﬃcient Portfolio Optimization Using Deep Neural Networks  625  can also be applied to automatic music generation [8], food recognition [9], and portfolio optimization problem [10–12].
In this paper, we aim at investigating a portfolio optimization problem in which by using historical stock data of diﬀerent tickers, one wants to ﬁnd the equally weighted portfolio having the highest Sharpe ratio [13] in the future.

, N [13].
In the equally weighted portfolio optimization problem, one can assume that wi = 1 N , and therefore, the “Sharpe ratio” can be determined as [13]:  (cid:2)N  Sharpe Ratio =  √  n ∗ E[R − Rf ] var[R − Rf ]  (cid:3)  ,  (1)  where n is an annualization factor of period (e.g, n= 252 for trading date in one year) and Rf is the risk-free rate, the expected return of any portfolio with no risk.
2.2 A New Loss Function for the Sharpe-Ratio Maximization Traditionally, one can estimate the maximum value of the Sharpe ratio by solving the following optimization problem [19] :  ˆw = argmin  (cid:4)  (cid:5) wT Qw − λwT μ  /  (cid:4)  wT w  (cid:5)  .

Recurrent Unit [16] architectures as two baseline models.
ResNet architecture has been proven to become one of the most eﬃcient deep learning models in computer vision, whose the ﬁrst version was proposed by He et al. [22].
After that, these authors later released the second update for ResNet [14].
There are many types of attention models, including Bahdanau attention [18], Luong Attention [21], and Self Attention [17].
Although the attention mechanism  DELAFO: An Eﬃcient Portfolio Optimization Using Deep Neural Networks  629  has been applying for the stock price prediction [23], there is few attention scheme used for maximizing the Sharpe ratio in the portfolio optimization problem.
3.1 Model Conﬁguration In our experiments, all proposed models use the Adam optimizer [24] with the optimal learning rate α = 0.0762, β1 = 0.9, and β2 = 0.999.
