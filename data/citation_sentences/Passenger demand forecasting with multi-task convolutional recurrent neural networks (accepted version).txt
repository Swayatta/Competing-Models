On the one hand, drivers often have to drive a long way before they can ﬁnd passengers due to low demand volumes in their locations [5]; on the other hand, passengers may experience long delays in obtaining a ride due to the high demand in their locations.
Traditional methods [6][7] utilize time series models such as AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and its variants to predict trafﬁc.
However, recent studies [2][3][8] have revealed that a region’s passenger demand is also related to other regions demand and thus utilizing the spatial relationship between regions could positively help predict future passenger demand.
There are two ways of utilizing the spatial relationships in literature: (1) Treating the whole city as an image (a two-dimensional matrix) and applying CNN [2][12] or Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) [13][1] directly to this image to capture relationships among all regions.
However, previous works either don’t take these external features into account [6][8] or directly map external features to future passenger demand [1][4][13], which can lead to large biases because the inﬂuence of external factors is not uniform to all regions.
Notation 1: Region We utilize the road networks based partition [4] to divide the entire city into blocks as it is more ﬂexible and can integrate semantic meanings into regions.
Deﬁnition 2: Crowd Outﬂow [11] We use PT (ri) to denote the set of people in region ri at time T. The crowd outﬂow of region ri during time interval t can be deﬁned as Ct(ri) = PT (ri) \ PT +∆T (ri).
The state-of-the-art methods [1][4][13] usually map external features to the value of the passenger demand directly, which can result in signiﬁcant errors and thus doesn’t make the best use of external features.
– XGBoost [14]: XGBoost is a boosting tree-based machine learning method, which is used to achieve state-of-the-art results on many data mining challenges.
– DMVST-Net [2]: DMVST-Net is a state-of-the-art method for predict passenger demand.

As described in Section 1, DMVST-Net [2] can only be used when the city is partitioned to grids.
– Nearest: Similar with DMVST-Net, it only considers spatially nearby regions  to capture their spatial correlations;  – PoI: Select correlated regions by PoI similarity; – Order: Select correlated regions by historical demand series similarity; – All: Similar with DeepST [12], it captures the spatial correlations within the  whole city.
Luis Moreira-Matias et al. [6] combined three time-series forecasting techniques (Time-Varying Poisson Model, Weighted Time-Varying Poisson Model, ARIMA model) to arrive at a prediction.
Xiaolong Li et al. [7] proposed an improved ARIMA model to forecast the spatial-temporal variation of passengers in hotspots.
In recent years, some researchers have applied deep learning methods in smart transportation systems [10].
Rose Yu et al. [9] proposed to use Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the temporal relationship in historical observations and used auto-encoder to process static features.
Wang et al. [5] presented a neural network framework based on fully-connected layers and residual network to predict the gap between passenger demand and supply.
Junbo Zhang et al. [3] propose a spatial-temporal model to predict citywide crowd ﬂow.
Huaxiu Yao et al. [2] further designed “local CNN” to extract spatial relationship within surrounding regions and construct a weighted graph to represent similarity among regions.
