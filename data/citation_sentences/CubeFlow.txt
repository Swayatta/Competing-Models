Although, FlowScope [12] designed for dense and multi-step ﬂow, it fails to take into account some important properties (e.g.
Khan et al. [9] used Bayesian network designed with guidance of the rules to assign risk scores to transactions.
[9] used Bayesian network designed with guidance of the rules to assign risk scores to transactions.
The system proposed by [10] monitored ongoing transactions and assessed their degree of anomaly.
To involve more attributes and handle the highdimensional data, machine learning models such as SVM [21], decision trees [22] and neural networks [15] are applied, while these methods are focused on isolated transaction level.

SpokEn [17] studied patterns in eigenvectors, and was applied for anomaly detection in [8] later.

D-Cube [19], M-Zoom [18] and CrossSpot [6] adopted greedy approximation algorithms to detect dense subtensors, while CP Decomposition (CPD) [11] focused on tensor decomposition methods.
Czech Financial Data (CFD) is an anonymous transferring data of Czech bank released for Discovery Challenge in [16].
Implementations: We implement CubeFlow in Python, CP Decomposition(CPD) [11] in Matlab and run the open source code of D-Cube [19], MZoom [18]and CrossSpot [6].
