Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) [14].
First, they are not end-to-end – they rely on the tedious process of manual selection of meta-paths or meta-graphs, followed by oﬄine embedding construction [12], similarity [3] or commuting matrix computation [22] for the entities in the HIN.
Further, the proposed model in [3] uses similarity matrices which are ineﬃcient in both memory and computation.
Further, individually on these sub-graphs, we employ a multi-layer graph attention mechanism (GAT [16]) to construct ﬁrst-level view-wise embeddings  32  M. Vijaikumar et al. k  ,  j  k  j  exp(a(ci  G and ci  where αi  (j,k) =  αi (j,k)W i  for the items.
We then aggregate the representations view-wise (into πs  (u,j)) as follows,  (u,j) = A({¯h(s,γ) πs  }Γ γ=1, pu),  (6) where Γ denotes the total number of memory networks and A(·) denotes attention network [9].
2.2 Loss Function  Since our ratings are implicit (binary), one can use point-wise loss functions such as cross-entropy [3,4] or pair-wise loss functions such as BPR-loss [11].
Here, D = D+ ∪ D− (cid:4)) (cid:5)∈ Ω}, and D−  samp where D+ := {(u, j) ∈ Ω} and D−  samp is obtained using a negative sampling procedure [10].

– HERec [12] is a recently proposed two-stage approach for heterogeneous recommendation setting.
In the ﬁrst stage, it computes user and item embeddings oﬄine using a meta-path based random walk and skip-gram technique [10].

FMG [22] is another recently proposed model that utilizes commuting matrices learned from meta-graph based strategy.
Since it has been shown in [3] that NeuACF outperforms FMG, we omit this from the comparison.

4 Related Work  Early CF techniques are mainly based on matrix factorization models – BPR [11] and MF [6] – and their extensions [7].
In recent years, due to their rich representation capabilities, several neural networks and deep learning models are developed for top-N recommendation settings [21].
For instance, NeuMF [4] combines MF with a multi-layer perceptron to learn better representations for users and items through MF as well as neural networks.
Further, autoencoders and variational autoencoders [8] and graph neural network-based models [19] have also been proposed for recommendation systems.
For instance, HeteRec [20] uses metapath based similarity construction followed by the Bayesian ranking optimization technique for the top-N recommendation.
Besides, SemRec [13] employs weighted meta-paths to prioritize and personalize user preferences on diﬀerent paths.
Further, the memory attention network has been employed in the context of top-N social [1] and multi-media [2] recommendation tasks.
In terms of utilizing multiple views (aspects) for the items from the HIN, our work is related to NeuACF [3], MCRec [5], HERec [12], KGAT [17] and FMG [22].
For instance, NeuACF [3] follows a two-stage approach – in the ﬁrst stage, it constructs similarity matrices.
KGAT [17] incorporates information from the knowledge graph using graph neural networks.
Further, Hu et al. [5] proposes a three-way neural interaction model with co-attention for the top-N heterogeneous recommendation.
In place of meta-paths, FMG [22] proposes meta-graphs for extracting knowledge from HIN.
Further, Shi et al. [12] propose HERec that fuses meta-path based embeddings into extended MF model.
